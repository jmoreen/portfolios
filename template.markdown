(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### 

When working on a project of homework and I get stuck I can have a fixed mindset.  Things came more easily at the last job, perhaps because I could see where I was going.  Having a fixed mindset can occur more often when I've spent all day studying, but don't even know where to begin.
